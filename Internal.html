<p style="color:black;background-color:yellow">PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale 
last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with 
a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane 
onto one of the eight maps which have different sizes and terrain.The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, 
requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.Players start with no gear beyond customized
clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons,
vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain
high-risk zones typically having better equipment.Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.Players can opt to
play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational
awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.
Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe 
area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the 
boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of 
encounters.During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players 
who remain in that area.In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety. A plane will fly over various parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot 
package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, drawing 
interested players near it and creating further confrontations.On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.</p>
